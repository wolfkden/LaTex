\section{Introduction}

The namesake of spinor harkens from the observable fine structure of
hydrogen energy spectra. The concept of the spinor defies representation
by the classical geometries of spatial coordinates and momenta.
Mathematically, particle spin is a manifestation of the discontinuities
in the rotation group $SO(3)$ of a sphere $S^2$. The spin group, $Sp(3)$,
corresponds directly with a binary, $\mathbb{Z}_2$, cover of the
rotational group, $S(3)$.

\begin{equation}
Sp(3) / \mathbb{Z}_2 \cong SO(3)
\end{equation}

The seminal contribution of spin structure of electron energy states
was introduced by Pauli in 1927, \cite{pauli1927}, and Dirac in 1928,
\cite{dirac1928}. Although an epic discovery in physics,
the spin concept, sans the moniker, spinor, was originated
in 1913 by the encompasing mathematical studies by \'{E}lie Cartan,
\cite{cartan1913}. Mathematically, the invariance of the spinor
in complex multilinear spaces was discovered by \'{E}lie Cartan
as an extension of the manifold
representations familiar to tensor calculus and exterior algebra.
The particle spin ansance of 1920's physics and Cartan's
prior accomplishement were
comprehensively recognized and further formalized in 1937 within several
mathematically rigorous treatise of spin
extending to general 2n and 2n+1 dimensional manifolds. Specifically,
spinors extend the multilinear concept of tensors to include
double sheeted coverings of manifolds.
Henceforth, the lecture notes of \'{E}lie Cartan summarized and
elaborated the accomplishments of physicists, Pauli \cite{pauli1927}
and Dirac \cite{dirac1928} as well as the mathematicians,
Brauer and Weyl, \cite{brauerweyl1937}.
In 1966, the published lecture notes were posthumously
translated into english \cite{cartan1966}.

Peripatetically, this manuscript approaches spinor analysis
with various algebraic structures, most generally with modules and lie algebra.
Algebraic structures of module, field and lie algebra are variously used
in the following mathematical developments although generalizations are
introduced to adjust to specific interpretations in physics and
computational application.

Fundamental algebraic structures used are monoid, ring and module, \cite{rotman1998},\cite{lang2002}.


\section{Division Algebra}

Division algebra provides an accessible approach to engage the reader
with Lie theory development and spinor concepts. Division algebras
embraces the earliest development of modular spaces from in the
19\textsuperscript{th} century. Basic properties of a division algebra, $\mathbb{A}$, are the folowing:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\small (Base Field)} $\mathbb{R}$
\item \textbf{\small (Fundamental Form)} there exists a fundamental form $\Phi$
  acting on elements $x\in\mathbb{A}$ such that $\Phi(x)$ provides a partial ordering on elements of $\mathbb{A}$
\end{itemize}

For initial exposition one notes that a division algebra can be an extension of a
base algebra relative to a module element. More generally, division algebras
may be generated from base modules and ring domains.

To begin, the real number line, $\mathbb{R}$, provides a base field.
The real line, $\mathbb{R}$, is a commutative field as well as a simple manifold familiar to most readers.
As a division algebra, the fundamental form is the square of real numbers will be the fundamental form,
$\Phi(x)=x^2,\,\forall\, x\in\mathbb{R}$. 

A curious geometric feature of the real line however is the lack of algebraic closure.
Closure of the real field, $\mathbb{R}$, is key to deriving more complex division algebra.
For closure the real field, $\mathbb{R}$, is extended to a polynomial domain, $\mathbb{R}(x)$.
In particular the monic polynomial, $1+x^2\in\mathbb{R}(x)$, augments the fundamental form,
is irreducable and does not have real roots in $\mathbb{R}$.
As an irriducible, the polynomial $1+x^2$ is a generator of the ideal $\{1+x^2\}$ over the
domain $\mathbb{R}(x)$. A division algebra is formed from $\mathbb{R}[x]$ over the ideal $\{x^2+1\}$ is:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:complexfield}
\mathbb{R}[x]/\{x^2+1\}
\end{equation}

The division ring, eq. \ref{eq:complexfield}, reduces each polynomial of $\mathbb{R}[x]$
to coset polynomial of order 1, equivalently a vector in $\mathbb{R}^2$:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:complexreduce}
  p(x)\equiv a+bx \in \mathbb{R}[x]/\{x^2+1\}\, ,
\end{equation}
\begin{center}
where $p(x)\in\mathbb{R}[x]$ and $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$.
\end{center}

The ring, $\mathbb{R}[x]$, splits over the irreducible polynomial, $x^2+1$, eq. \ref{eq:complexreduce}.

Further inspection of the polynomial $x^2+1$ proves to have an symbolic solution designated as $\di{i}$,
hence the moniker, imaginary number.
A little analysis further shows the division ring, eq. \ref{eq:complexfield}, to be isomorphic to the
complex number field, $\mathbb{C}$.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:complexclosure}
\mathbb{C}\cong\mathbb{R}(x)\equiv\mathbb{R}[x]/(x^2+1)
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eq:complexclosure} is a well known result in algebra, the closure of the polynomial ring,
$\mathbb{R}[\,x]\,$, is the complex field, $\mathbb{C}$, or otherwise stated all roots of the polynomial ring
are contained within the complex field.

This this process continues to develop the quaternion non-abelian field, $\mathbb{Q}$,
and the octonian composition algebra, $\mathbb{O}$.

To develop the next level of division algevra polynomial domain, $\mathbb{C}[x]$ extended from the complex
numbers $\mathbb{C}$. To define a fundamental form for $\mathbb{C}$ over the extension field $\mathbb{C}[x]$
is necessary. Once again an extension element is introduced, $\di{j}$, as a solution to the polynomial $X^2+1$.
The two imaginary extension units, $\di{i}$ and $\di{j}$ anticommute to extablish a reflection operation over
$\mathbb{C}[x]$. The reflection operator $\di{j}$ defines a partial order over $\mathbb{C}$ as
$(xj)^2=xjxj=xx^*jj=-xx^*=-|x|^2$, the reflection operation, $*$, is complex conjugation. For
$|x|^2=1$ with $x\in\mathbb{C}$ shows a new solution to $(xj)^2+1$. 

The quaternion field derives from the extension of $\mathbb{C}[x]$ with unit operators $\di{j}$. Unit operators
$\di{i}$ and $\di{j}$ combinded to form a third unit operator $\di{k}.

\begin{align} 
  \di{k}=\di{i}\cdot\di{j}=-\di{j}\cdot\di{i} \label{eq:qunit1} \\
  \di{i}\cdot\di{k}=\di{i}\cdot\di{i}\cdot\di{j}=-\di{j} \label{eq:qunit2} \\
  \di{k}\cdot\di{j}=\di{i}\cdot\di{j}\cdot\di{j}=-\di{i} \label{eq:qunit3} \\
  \di{k}^2=\di{i}\cdot\di{j}\cdot\di{i}\cdot\di{j}=-\di{i}\cdot\di{i}\cdot\di{j}\cdot\di{j}=-1 \label{eq:qunit4} \\
  -1=\di{i}^2=\di{j}^2=\di{k}^2 \label{eq:qunit5}
\end{align}

The properties of the qaternion unit operators affords a quaternion modular form with real coefficients:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:quaternion}
  q\in\mathbb{Q}\,\,,q=r+x\di{i}+x\di{j}+x\di{k}\,\,,r,x,y,z\in\mathbb{R}
\end{equation}

The anti-commuting properties, eqs. \ref{eq:qunit1} \ref{eq:qunit2} \ref{eq:qunit3},
of the extension units prove the quaternion field to have anti-commutative properties as well.

Again a new conjugation operator for the quaternion field and a subsequently more complex division algebra is sought.

This manuscript expands the formalisms of multilinear algebra and tensors
derived from a fundamental form, $\Phi$, over a pseudo-Euclidean vector
space, $V$. Vector spaces are defined over a field designated, $K$,
generally assumed a closed complex field, $\mathbb{C}$, unless confined to
the real field, $\mathbb{R}$. A general vector space, $V$,
has a dimension, $n\in\mathbb{N}$,
consisting of a set of vectors defined over the field, $K$,

\begin{equation}
V = \left\{v\mid\ v=\left(x_1\dots x_n\right),\,x_i\in K\right\}.
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\small (Reflection Operator)} there exists a real subspace, $\Re$, and an imaginary subspace, $\Im$,
  of the division algebra, $\mathbb{A}$
\end{itemize}

The fundamental form provides a base measure to develop a bilinear form to
determine similarities between elements of $\mathbb{A}$
and reflections in subspaces of $\mathbb{A}$, 

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\small (Bilinear Form)} $\langle x,y\rangle={1\over 2}(\Phi (x-y)-\Phi(x)-\Phi(y)})$ 
\end{itemize}



Essentially each vector is a list of, $n$, field elements,
indexed from the set $\left[n\right]=\left\{1,\dots,n\right\}$.
In general the vector space, $V$, is a an algebra over a ring.
Typically the ring is precipitated by modular structures
to form a finite dimensional basis. 

Exampli gratia, a ring is restricted to the well behaved field of
real numbers, $\mathbb{R}$. 
$\left\{e_i\mid e_ie_j=\delta_{ij}e_i\right\}$ where $\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta function.
The representation of this group is the direct sum over the field, $K$.

\begin{equation}
V = \left\{v\mid\ v=\left(x_1\dots x_n\right),\,x_i\in K\right\}.
\end{equation}


Original terminology introduced by early authors such as Cartan and Weyl are referenced.
The linear concepts of a Cartesian coordinate frame and Sylvesters law of inertia underly
the field theory of general manifolds. In particular, the theorems of
Cartan-Dieudonn\'{e} provides a natural definition of basis, reflection and rotations.

\section{Appendix}

The following algebraic definitions are detailed in Serge Lang's text, \cite{lang2002},
and Joseph Rotman's text, \cite{rotman1998}.

A monoid $(G,\cdot,e)$ consists of a set $G$ with a binary operator,
$\cdot\, {:}\, G \times G \to G$, with an identity element, $e \in G$.
Demonstrating properties with elements $a,b,c\in G$:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\small (Closure)} $a\cdot b \in G,\, \forall \, a,b \in G$
\item \textbf{\small (Identity)} $a\cdot e = e \cdot a = a,\, \forall\,a \in G$
\item \textbf{\small (Associative)}
  $a \cdot (b\cdot c) = (a\cdot b)\cdot c,\,\forall\,a,b,c\in G$
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
where the function $\cdot(a,b) \equiv a\cdot b$
\end{center}

The trivial monoid consists of a single identity element, $\{e\}$.

A monoid is commutative if the binary operator has equal results for transpositions of the input argument pair:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\small (Commutative)} $a\cdot b=b\cdot a\in G,\, \forall a,b \in G$
\end{itemize}

Algebraic structures with commutative algebraic operations are abelian.

A monoid, $(G,\cdot,e)$, is a group if for every element, $a \in G$, there exists an element $a^{-1}\in G$ such that:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\small (Inverse)}
  $a\cdot a^{-1}=a^{-1}\cdot a=e\in G,\, \forall a \in G$
\end{itemize}

As a corollary, an inverse of any element is unique.

Monoids and groups are algebraic structures with one binary operator. A compositional algebra is a structure
with more than one binary operator acting on a set of elements. The simplest compositional algebra is a ring.
A ring with identity, $(R,+,\cdot,0,1)$, is a composition of an additive commutative group $(R,+,0)$
and a multiplicative monoid $(R\backslash\{0\},\cdot,1)$. The composition of operators demonstrate distributive properties:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\small (Left Distributive)}
  $a\cdot(b + c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c \in R,$
\item \textbf{\small (Right Distributive)}
  $(a + b)\cdot c = a \cdot c + b \cdot c \in R,$
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
  $\forall a,b,c \in R$.
\end{center}

The trivial ring consists of one element with one property:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{(\small Trivial Ring)} $\mathfrank{Z}=\{0\}$ where $1=0$.
\end{itemize}

Unless otherwise stated all rings are assumed not trivial.

The distributive properties of a ring assert the following corollaries:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\small (Zero)} $0\cdot a = a \cdot 0 =0,\,\forall a \in R,$
\item \textbf{\small (Unit Reflection)} $(-1)+1=1+(-1)=1-1=0$
\item \textbf{\small (Element Reflection)} $(-1)\cdot a=a\cdot (-1)=-a,\,(-a)+a=a+(-a)=a-a=0,\,\forall a\in R
  $(a + b)\cdot c = a \cdot c + b \cdot c \in R,$
\end{itemize}

A ring, $R$, has an ideal subset, $\mathfrak{I}\subset R$:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{(Coset)} $a-b\in \mathfrak{I}\,\,\forall\, a,b\in\mathfrak{I}$
\item \textbf{(Closure)} $r\cdot a\in \mathfrak{I}$ and $a\cdot r\in \mathfrak{I}$ $\forall\, a\in\mathfrak{I},\,r\in R$
\end{itemize}

All rings have the ideals, $\{0\}$, and $R$.

If the multiplicative monoid $(R\backslash\{0\},\cdot,1)$ of a ring, $R$, is commutative then $R$ is commutative.

The zero divisor subset, $ZD$, of a ring, $R$, consists of elements with the following property:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\small (Zero Divisor)} $ZD\subset R$ such that $\forall\,a\in ZD$ there exists $b\in ZD$ where
  $a\cdot b=0$ or $b\cdot a=0$
\end{itemize}

A ring with a trivial zero divisor set, $ZD=\{0\}$, is an integral domain.

A nontrivial ring, $(R,+,\cdot,0,1)$, also has a nontrivial subset, $R^*\subset R\backslash\{0\}$, of units.
All nontrivial have the unit $1$, the multiplicative identity.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\small (Unit)} $R^*\subset R\backslash\{0\}$, $1\in R^*$, $\forall u\in R^*$ there exists $u^{-1}\in R^*$
  such that $u\cdot u^{-1}=u^{-1}\cdot u = 1$
\end{itemize}

A ring consisting wholely of units and the additive identity is a field, $R=\{0\} \cup R^*$.

A more complex compositional structure is a modules which consists of a ring subset.
A left module is a compositional algebra
of an additive group, $(M,+,0)$ and a ring $(R,\cdot,0,1)$. 
Elements of the module, $M$, are constructed or extended from dependent ring elements, $R$. For instance
a module may be a basis of ideals, multivectors, derivations, matrices or tensors. Modules share
several distributive properties:

\begin{itemize}
\item $r\cdot (x+y)=r\cdot x + r\cdot y \in M,\,\forall r\in R$ and $x,y\in M$
\item $(r+s)\cdot x=r\cdot x + s\cdot x \in M,\,\forall r,s\in R$ and $x\in M$
\item $(r\cdot s)\cdot x=r\cdot (s\cdot x) \in M,\,\forall r,s\in R$ and $x\in M$
\item $1\cdot x = x,\, \forall x \in M$
\end{itemize}

A right module transposes operation properties of the ring $R$ relative to the left module, $M$.

A bimodule is both a left module and a right module.

Any ring, $R$, may be extended to a module by introduction of discrete external module symbols.
A symbol set, $X=\left\{x_i\mid i\in\J\right\}$, declared over the index set, $J$.
The elements of $X$ and a coefficient from the ring $R$ may be combined freely into a word of
length $n+1$, where the degree of the monomial is $n \in \mathbb{N}$. The set of monomials $M$ is a subset of
$\cup_{n\in\mathbb{N}} R\times X^n$.
A module is generated over the monomial set with the monoid $(M,1,+),\,1\in R$.
Left modules assign coefficients to the left of monomials and right modules alternately.
such as a the left module generated over the left monomial set,
$\alpha x_ {i_1}x_{i_1}\dots x_{i_n},\,\alpha\in R,\,x_{i_j}\inX$.
It is easy to see that $R$ is a subset of the module $M$.

The set $X$ over a field $R$ may act as coxeter groups to form division and Lie algebras.
Classical polynomial representations assume that the set $X$ and the units of $R$ are an abelian group:

\begin{center}
$\alpha\cdot\prod_{x\in X}x^{i_x},\,i_x\in\mathbb{N},\,\alpha\in R$
\end{center}

Polynomial modules are rings. Hence, if the base ring is a domain then the polynomial ring is also a domain.

polynomial domains have irreducuble elements.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\small (Irreducible)} $p\in M$ is irreducuble if $p=q\cdot r\,\Rightarrow$ either $q$ or $r$ is a unit of $M$.
\end{itemize}
